🚗 Uber Trip Analytics & BI Dashboard Project
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of cleaning, preparing, and analysing an Uber ride-hailing dataset. Using Python (Pandas) for data cleaning and Power BI for analytics and visualization, it uncovers key insights on trip patterns, revenue, customer behaviour, and vehicle performance.
🎯 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze a real-world Uber trip dataset to uncover operational and customer insights such as:

•	Revenue trends by month and vehicle type
•	Trip demand patterns by hour, weekday, and location
•	Customer behavior and high-value rider identification
•	Payment mode preferences
•	Forecasting future trips and demand
•	Pickup location hotspots and route behavior

🧰 Tools & Technologies:
•	Programming Language: Python
•	Analytics & Visualization Tool: Power BI
•	Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
•	Environment: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
•	Dashboard File: uber_project.pbix
🧼 Data Preparation (Python Cleaning Workflow)
Data Extraction
Raw trip data was loaded into Python using Pandas.
Data Transformation
Data cleaning included:
•	Removing unwanted characters (") from Booking IDs
•	Standardizing date columns and creating a unified trip_datetime
•	Converting fare, distance, and ratings to numeric
•	Handling missing values in payment method & ratings
•	Dropping duplicate records
•	Engineering new fields:
-Trip Hour
- Day Type (Weekend / Weekday)
- Revenue Per KM
- Trips Per Customer
Data Export
The cleaned dataset was saved as Uber_Final.csv and loaded into Power BI for modeling and visualization.

📊 Dashboard Overview (Power BI)
The dashboard consists of two interactive pages, providing insights into revenue, trips, customer behavior, and locations.
📍 PAGE 1 — Revenue & Business Insights
Key Metrics (KPIs)
•	Total Revenue: 52M
•	Average Fare: 345.64
•	Revenue per KM: 20.63
Insights Covered
•	Revenue by Vehicle Type
Auto and Go Mini contribute the highest revenue.
•	Monthly Revenue Trend
Seasonal peaks visible around April & November.
•	Top 10 Pickup Locations
High-demand hotspots such as Khandsa, Saket, Barakhamba Road, etc.
•	Revenue Per Customer
Identifies high-value customers and their trip frequency.
•	Revenue by Day Type
Weekday trips contribute significantly more than weekend trips.
Slicer: Vehicle Type
📍 PAGE 2 — Trip Trends & Customer Behavior
Key Metrics (KPIs)

•	Total Bookings: 150K
•	Average Distance: 16.75 km
•	Total Riders: 149K

Insights Covered
•	Ride Trends by Hour
Peak ride demand around 10 AM and 6 PM.
•	Yearly Ride Trend (with Forecast)
Shows stable trend with future demand prediction.
•	Weekday vs Weekend Trips
Weekdays show higher ride volumes due to work commute.
•	Payment Method Preference
UPI leads as the most preferred mode.
Slicers:
Date Range | Day Type | Payment Method | Vehicle Type | Trip Hour
🧮 Key DAX Measures
The project includes essential measures such as:
•	Total Trips
•	Total Riders
•	Total Revenue
•	Total Distance
•	Average Fare
•	Avg Distance
•	Revenue Per KM
•	Trips Per Customer
•	High Value Customer Logic
(clean, optimized, and minimal)

💡 Business Insights
Sales & Revenue
•	Auto generates the highest revenue among vehicle types.
•	Revenue spikes occur in specific months due to seasonal demand.
Customer Behavior
•	UPI is the dominant payment mode.
•	A small percentage of customers contribute heavily to total revenue.
Operational Insights
•	Evening and morning hours show peak demand.
•	Weekday bookings significantly exceed weekend rides.
•	Top pickup hotspots help in resource allocation.
Forecasting
Future demand appears stable, supporting operational planning.

⚙ How to Run the Project

•	Clone/download your project folder

•	Ensure the cleaned dataset Uber_Final.csv is available
